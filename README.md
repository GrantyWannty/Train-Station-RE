Minecraft Railway Empire -=- Train Station
============================
Welcome to my Github structures! Either from visiting here, or linked by my youtube channel, you can find all my Minecraft Create structures, based off of the game Railway Empire.
I try to put as much detail as I can in these to be as closly related to the actual structures

This structure is the Train Station, which is found in cities.
This structure is what loads your trains with passengers, mail and other goods; and where goods can be unloaded to increase satisfaction, therefore could grow a city. Unloaded goods can also be used as ingredients in factories.
Also has increased space, prior to the Small Train Station.
